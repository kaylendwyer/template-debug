### Workshops
Six 90-minute webinar-style workshops will include technical trainings and discussions that expand upon the topics covered during the in-person program, or delve into new areas. Specific topics will be determined in collaboration with the participants, based on their needs at the end of the in-person  program.

### Consultations
Institute instructors will conduct hour-long consultations with each project team, four times during the course of the year. 

---

### Discussions
Institute staff will maintain an online forum and encourage participants to ask questions, share news, updates, and resources, and discuss challenges and other topics of interest.

### Virtual Symposium
The Institute will conclude in June 2023 with a virtual symposium featuring presentations from project teams reporting on progress made during the year and sharing reflections. The presentations will be recorded and posted on the Institute website for public viewing.

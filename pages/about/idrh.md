**Since 2010, the IDRH has provided an intellectual hub for digital humanities inquiry and practices that reaches across and beyond the KU campus.**

In addition to its annual [DH Forum](https://idrh.ku.edu/dh-forum-archives), which attracts up to 120 local, regional, national, and international participants each year, the IDRH has organized 170 workshops, provided seed grants and teaching grants to KU faculty, and helped over 1500 scholars learn the digital humanities. The IDRH has provided mentorship to more than 20 undergraduate and graduate students through the HASTAC Scholars program. 

Recent activity includes the [African Digital Humanities initiative](http://africandh.ku.edu), and a [DH Fellows](https://idrh.ku.edu/fellows) program that brings together an interdisciplinary cohort of faculty and graduate students for a year to explore the politics, ethics, and techniques of digital storytelling.

The Institute is dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of Institute participants in any form. 

The Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities is committed to diversity, equity, access, and inclusion. As a community of researchers and non-profit organizers, we are dedicated to openness and collaboration across disciplinary and institutional boundaries, welcoming all who are interested in digital approaches to humanistic inquiry, both beginner and expert, on campus and off.

## Case Studies
Each day of the institute will open with a case study presented by that project’s director. These case studies highlight a range of platforms and modes of digital scholarship (e.g., archiving, mapping, oral histories, storytelling) and will provide participants with real-world examples to draw from.

## Online Program
After the completion of the in-person program, the institute will continue virtually for one year in the form of workshops, consultations, and email discussions. This is the time for the participants to return home and put the lessons learned during the in-person week into practice to advance their projects.
